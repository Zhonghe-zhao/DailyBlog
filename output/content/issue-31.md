一些很好的建议！

1. >“It’s not an apology if it comes with an excuse. It is not a compliment if it comes with a request. ”

如果道歉夹带理由或借口，本质上是在为自己开脱，而不是承担责任。真正的道歉应当是直面错误，不推卸、不辩解。

如果夸奖后立刻提要求，这夸奖就成了手段，不是发自内心的赞赏。真诚的赞美不图回报，只是表达认可。

2. >"Learn how to learn from those you disagree with, or even offend you. See if you can find the truth in what they believe. "

放下成见，善于从不同或对立的观点中吸取智慧，这能拓宽你的认知边界。

3. > "Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better."

时间压力能激发创新，不要浪费时间在琐碎细节上。
